If would re-do, probably use:

0.01 - 1 the same (width = 1)


1.07 * 2 	--> 2.5%

1.35 * 3	--> 5%

1.55 * 5	--> 10.1%
OR
1.97 * 4	--> 10%


Others for notes:
2.5 * X		--> scribbles creation struggles...
2.5 * 1		--> 2.47%
2.5 * 2		--> 5.82%
1.07 * 4	--> 5.52%
1.35 * 5 	--> 8.81%
1.5 * 5		--> 9.74%
1.35 * 6	--> 10.65%
