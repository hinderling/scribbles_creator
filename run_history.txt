(V01 - images 0-4)

pred01 - images 0-10 (scribbles local)
	convpaint (default multichannel)
	Ch1 - only one channel because ilastik not ready for multichannel yet
	multichannel

cluster_run01 - ~100 images at a time (not complete), some scribbles not ideal in edge cases

cluster_run02 - optimized for edge cases (min 1 pixels etc.; not sped up lines yet)
	pred02 - some weird predicitons for convpaint ???
	450 - test on image with werid prediciton for convpaint...
	pred03 - predict again with fixed seed (= 123) --> similar weird predicitons
	pred04 - predict again with same seed (= 123) and channel extraction and normalization
	pred05 - test convpaint scalings and layers: predict every 10th image, but with 3 layer and 4 scaling combinations (= total 12x)
		run01: was interrupted by errors, but still some results
		run02: only done with l-0 and l-0-2 but all scalings
		test: just to make sure the results can be reproduced with img 500, and testing different seeds... (x: seed=123, y: seed=5)
		run03: same as run02 but with 1% scribbles





test convpaint params, 1% scribbles
